## English

We have met at the Global GameJam 2017 in Hamburg and developed a game on a given topic.

The topic this year is: "waves"

Our game idea is to create a browser game with javaScript. In this game you have to hit the other player with a wave 
ore damage the ground to create traps so he can fall out of the world.

### Contolls

Player one moves his char with w, a, s, d and triggers his wave by press the t, f, g ,h keys.

Player two moves his char with i, j, k, l and triggers his wave by press the arrow keys.
