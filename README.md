We have met at the Global GameJam 2017 in Hamburg and developed a game on a given topic.

The topic this year is: "waves"

Our game idea is to create a browser game with javaScript. In this game you have to hit the other
 player with a wave ore damage the ground to create traps so he can fall out of the wold.
